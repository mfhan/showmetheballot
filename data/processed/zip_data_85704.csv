## Amphitheater Unified School District, Arizona, Proposition 413, Budget Override Measure (November 2024)

“Shall the Governing Board of Amphitheater Unified School District No. 10 of Pima County, Arizona (the “District”), adopt a General Maintenance and Operation Budget that includes an amount that exceeds the revenue control limit specified by statute by 13.5% for fiscal year 2025/2026 and for six subsequent years as described below? The fiscal year 2025/2026 budget override authority represents a combination and extension of the existing budget override authorities which are scheduled to phase down by one-third for fiscal year 2025/2026, by another one-third for fiscal year 2026/2027, and will terminate for fiscal year 2027/2028 if the voters do not approve the override.The amount of the proposed continuation of the budget increase of the proposed budget over the alternate budget for fiscal year 2025/2026 is estimated to be $4,064,384. In fiscal years 2025/2026 through 2029/2030 the amount of the proposed increase will be 13.5% of the District’s revenue control limit in each of such years, as provided in Section 15-481(P) of the Arizona Revised Statutes. In fiscal years 2030/2031 and 2031/2032, the amount of the proposed increase will be 9.0% and 4.5%, respectively, of the District’s revenue control limit in each of such years, as provided in Section 15-481(P) of the Arizona Revised Statutes. Any budget increase continuation authorized by this election shall be entirely funded by a levy of taxes on the taxable property in this school district for the year for which adopted and for six (6) subsequent years, shall not be realized from monies furnished by the state and shall not be subject to the limitation on taxes specified in Article IX, Section 18, Constitution of Arizona. Based on the current net assessed valuation used for secondary property tax purposes, to fund the proposed continuation of the increase in the school district’s budget would require an estimated continuation of a tax rate of $0.62 per one hundred dollars of assessed valuation used for secondary property tax purposes and is in addition to the school district’s tax rate that will be levied to fund the school district’s revenue control limit allowed by law.”

In fiscal years 2030/2031 and 2031/2032, the amount of the proposed increase will be 9.0% and 4.5%, respectively, of the District\u2019s revenue control limit in each of such years, as provided in Section 15-481(P) of the Arizona Revised Statutes. Any budget increase continuation authorized by this election shall be entirely funded by a levy of taxes on the taxable property in this school district for the year for which adopted and for six (6) subsequent years, shall not be realized from monies furnished by the state and shall not be subject to the limitation on taxes specified in Article IX, Section 18, Constitution of Arizona. Based on the current net assessed valuation used for secondary property tax purposes, to fund the proposed continuation of the increase in the school district\u2019s budget would require an estimated continuation of a tax rate of $0.62 per one hundred dollars of assessed valuation used for secondary property tax purposes and is in addition to the school district\u2019s tax rate that will be levied to fund the school district\u2019s revenue control limit allowed by law.\u201d"", ""type"": ""Ballot Measure"", ""level"": ""School District""}, {""title"": ""Arizona Proposition 133, Require Partisan Primaries and Prohibit Primaries Where Candidates Compete Regardless of Party Affiliation Amendment (2024)"", ""propositionId"": null, ""fullText"": ""\u201cPROPOSITION 133PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE ARIZONA CONSTITUTION BY THE LEGISLATURE RELATING TO PRIMARY ELECTIONSOfficial TitleAMENDING ARTICLE VII, SECTION 10, CONSTITUTION OF ARIZONADescriptive TitleNOTWITHSTANDING ANY CONTRARY CITY LAW, THE DIRECT PRIMARY ELECTION FOR PARTISAN OFFICES WOULD BE CONDUCTED TO ALLOW EACH RECOGNIZED POLITICAL PARTY TO NOMINATE AS MANY CANDIDATES FOR EACH OFFICE AS THERE ARE OPEN POSITIONS FOR THAT OFFICE IN THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION AND ALLOW OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE CANDIDATES TO BE NOMINATED[11]\u201d"", ""type"": ""Ballot Measure"", ""level"": ""State""}, {""title"": ""Arizona Proposition 134, Signature Distribution Requirement for Initiatives Amendment (2024)"", ""propositionId"": null, ""fullText"": ""\u201cPROPOSITION 134PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE ARIZONA CONSTITUTION BY THE LEGISLATURE RELATING TO INITIATIVES AND REFERENDA.Official TitleAMENDING ARTICLE IV, PART I, SECTION 10, CONSTITUTION OF ARIZONA.Descriptive TitleFOR A BALLOT MEASURE TO QUALIFY TO APPEAR ON THE BALLOT, SIGNATURES FROM A PERCENTAGE OF THE QUALIFIED ELECTORS IN ALL 30 LEGISLATIVE DISTRICTS WOULD BE REQUIRED, AS FOLLOWS: 10% FOR STATEWIDE INITIATIVES; 15% FOR CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS; AND 5% FOR STATEWIDE REFERENDA.[3]\u201d"", ""type"": ""Ballot Measure"", ""level"": ""State""}, {""title"": ""Arizona Proposition 135, Emergency Declarations Amendment (2024)"", ""propositionId"": null, ""fullText"": ""\u201cPROPOSITION 135PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE ARIZONA CONSTITUTION BY THE LEGISLATURE RELATING TO THE GOVERNOR.Official TitleAMENDING ARTICLE IV, PART 2, SECTION 1, CONSTITUTION OF ARIZONA.Descriptive TitleTERMINATES ANY EMERGENCY POWERS GRANTED TO THE GOVERNOR DURING A STATE OF EMERGENCY 30 DAYS AFTER THE PROCLAMATION, UNLESS EXTENDED BY THE LEGISLATURE, AND REQUIRES THE GOVERNOR TO CALL A SPECIAL SESSION UPON THE PRESENTATION OF A PETITION BEARING SIGNATURES OF AT LEAST ONE-THIRD OF EACH HOUSE OF THE LEGISLATURE.[4]\u201d"", ""type"": ""Ballot Measure"", ""level"": ""State""}, {""title"": ""Arizona Proposition 136, Legal Challenges to Constitutionality of Initiatives Amendment (2024)"", ""propositionId"": null, ""fullText"": ""\u201cPROPOSITION 136PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE ARIZONA CONSTITUTION BY THELEGISLATURE RELATING TO BALLOT MEASURES.Official TitleAMENDING ARTICLE IV, PART 1, SECTION 1, CONSTITUTION OF ARIZONA.Descriptive TitleAUTHORIZES A PERSON TO BRING A LAWSUIT TO TRY TO STOP A VOTER-PROPOSED INITIATIVE FROM BEING PLACED ON THE BALLOT IF THAT PERSON SUES AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION AND CLAIMS THE PROPOSED INITIATIVE WOULD VIOLATE THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION OR THE ARIZONA CONSTITUTION.[4]\u201d"", ""type"": ""Ballot Measure"", ""level"": ""State""}, {""title"": ""Arizona Proposition 137, End Term Limits and Retention Elections for Supreme Court Justices and Superior Court Judges Amendment (2024)"", ""propositionId"": null, ""fullText"": ""\u201cPROPOSITION 137PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE ARIZONA CONSTITUTION BY THE LEGISLATURE RELATING TO THE JUDICIAL DEPARTMENTOfficial TitleAMENDING ARTICLE VI, SECTIONS 4, 9, 12, 37, 38, 39, 41 AND 42, CONSTITUTION OF ARIZONA.Descriptive TitleELIMINATES JUDICIAL TERMS AND REGULAR RETENTION ELECTIONS AND NULLIFIES THE RESULTS OF THE 2024 JUDICIAL RETENTION ELECTIONS, FOR ARIZONA SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, COURT OF APPEALS JUDGES, AND SUPERIOR COURT JUDGES IN COUNTIES WITH OVER 250,000 PERSONS.
