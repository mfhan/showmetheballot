“Title: An Amendment to the South Dakota Constitution Updating Gender References for Certain Officeholders and Persons.Attorney General Explanation:The South Dakota Constitution became effective upon the State joining the United States in 1889.

For example, when referencing the Governor, instead of saying he shall be commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the state, the text will be changed to read “the Governor shall be commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the state. The amendment makes similar changes to other references to the Governor, as well as to references to other officeholders including Lieutenant Governor, Supreme Court Justices, and Circuit Court Judges. The amendment also makes similar changes to references in the Constitution to general classes of people such as persons, electors, and public officers.Vote Yes to adopt the amendment.Vote No to leave the Constitution as it is.[5]”
