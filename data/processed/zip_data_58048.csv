Additionally, the proposed amendments would require that constitutional initiated measures approved by the Secretary of State be voted upon by the voters at the next primary election and, if approved by a majority of the voters, voted upon at the general election immediately following the primary election; if the measure fails at either the primary or general election, the measure is deemed failed.The estimated fiscal impact of this measure is none.Yes – Means you approve the measure as summarized above.No – Means you reject the measure as summarized above.[3]”

It would prohibit political subdivisions from levying any tax on the assessed value of real or personal property, except for the payment of bonded indebtedness incurred through a certain date, and would require the state to provide replacement payments to political subdivisions of no less than the current real property tax levies. It would limit the debt of a political subdivision to an amount not to exceed two and one-half percent of the full and true value of the real property in the political subdivision; however, by a vote, an incorporated city could increase its indebtedness to four percent and a school district could increase its indebtedness to five percent. It would allow an incorporated city to become indebted in an amount not exceeding two percent of its full and true value for water and sewer projects. It would require a political subdivision incurring indebtedness to provide for annual revenues to pay the debt payments when due and would prohibit a political subdivision from issuing general obligation bonds secured with tax levied on the assessed value of property.The estimated fiscal impact of this measure is $3.15 billion increase in biennial expenditures to the

years of age or older; and provide that fees must be appropriated for administration of this chapter.

It would allow an incorporated city to become indebted in an amount not exceeding two percent of its full and true value for water and sewer projects. It would require a political subdivision incurring indebtedness to provide for annual revenues to pay the debt payments when due and would prohibit a political subdivision from issuing general obligation bonds secured with tax levied on the assessed value of property.The estimated fiscal impact of this measure is $3.15 billion increase in biennial expenditures to the
state beginning in the 2025-2027 biennium.Yes – Means you approve the measure as summarized above.No – Means you reject the measure as summarized above.[8]”
