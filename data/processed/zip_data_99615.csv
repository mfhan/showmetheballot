The minimum wage would increase with inflation after that. The minimum wage would always be at least $2 above the federal minimum wage.This act would also require paid sick leave for many employees. Smaller employers would allow 40 or more hours of sick leave per year. Larger employers would allow 56 or more hours. Sick leave would carry over to the next year.This act would prohibit employers from making their employees attend meetings about religious or political issues. These issues include whether or not to join or support a religious, political, or labor organization. Some employers would be exempt and all employers could still communicate about issues required by law or related to the workplace.Should this initiative become law?[4]”

The candidate with the most votes will win.This act would also bring back party petitions, special runoff elections, and other processes in place before 2022.
