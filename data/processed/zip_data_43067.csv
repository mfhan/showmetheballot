## Ohio Issue 1, Establish the Citizens Redistricting Commission Initiative (2024)

“When politicians draw biased voting districts to ensure their own re-election, it's called gerrymandering, and independent, nonpartisan experts have found thatOhio is one of the most gerrymandered states in America.In fact,the Ohio Supreme Court ruled 7 times that gerrymandered voting district maps —crafted by politicians under the current system — were unconstitutional.Ohio’s current system allows politicians of both parties and their lobbyist friends to gerrymander voting districts in secret backroom deals to manipulate the outcomes to benefit themselvesVoting YES on Issue 1 will ban politicians and lobbyists and make it illegal to gerrymander voting districts.Issue 1 will:Create the 15-member Ohio Citizens Redistricting Commission made up of Democratic, Republican, and Independent citizens who broadly represent the different geographic areas and demographics of the state.Ban politicians, political party officials and lobbyists from sitting on the Commission.Require fair and impartial districts by making it unconstitutional to draw voting districts that discriminate against or favor any political party or individual politician.Require the Commission to operate under an open and independent process.A broad spectrum of Ohioans, including Republicans, Independents, and Democrats all support Issue 1.More than 100 organizations from across the state have endorsed the measure, and a bipartisan group of 85 civic, community and business leaders endorsed Issue 1 as well.Vote YES on Issue 1 to restore power to where it belongs: with citizens, not politicians.[14]”
