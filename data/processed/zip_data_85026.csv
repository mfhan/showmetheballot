In fiscal years 2030/2031 and 2031/2032, the amount of the proposed increase will be 10% and 5%, respectively, of the District’s revenue control limit in each of such years, as provided in Section 15-481(P) of the Arizona Revised Statutes.Any budget increase continuation authorized by this election shall be entirely funded by a levy of taxes on the taxable property in this school district for the year for which adopted and for six (6) subsequent years, shall not be realized from monies furnished by the state and shall not be subject to the limitation on taxes specified in Article IX, Section 18, Constitution of Arizona.

In fiscal years 2025/2026 through 2029/2030 the amount of the proposed increase will be 15% of the District’s revenue control limit in each of such years, as provided in Section 15-481(P) of the Arizona Revised Statutes.
