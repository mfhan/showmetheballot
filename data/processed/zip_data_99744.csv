## Alaska Ballot Measure 2, Repeal Top-Four Ranked-Choice Voting Initiative (2024)

“An Act Restoring Political Party Primaries and Single-Choice General ElectionsThis act would get rid of open primary elections and ranked-choice general elections.It would bring back political party primaries and single-choice general elections.  Elections will occur exactly as they did before a previous ballot measure changed the election laws in 2022. In the primary election, voters will choose a party’s ballot. They will vote for one candidate and the winning candidate will be the party’s nominee. In the general election, voters will select one candidate. The candidate with the most votes will win.This act would also bring back party petitions, special runoff elections, and other processes in place before 2022. It would put all election laws, except campaign finance laws, back the way they were before 2022.Should this initiative become law?[11]”
